SpaceVim is a community-driven vim distribution that seeks to provide layer feature, especially for neovim. It offers a variety of layers to choose from. to create a suitable vim development environment, you just need to select the required layers. If you use SpaceVim,
please star it on github. It's a great way of getting feedback and gives me the kick to
put more time into development.
